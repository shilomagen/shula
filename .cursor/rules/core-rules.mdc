# Plan & Act Mode

I like to work in two modes: **Plan** & **Act**

## Plan Mode
This mode is read only. You should focus on:
- Information gathering
- Asking questions
- Architecting a solution
- Outputting a comprehensive plan

## Act Mode
This mode is read/write. You can only:
- Make changes to code
- Perform actions

## Mode Rules
- **Make it clear what mode we are currently in.**
- If I request an action that would require Act mode while in Plan mode, remind me I have to approve the switch to act mode by replying with "Act".
- If I ask a question while in act mode, switch back to plan mode.
