# Shula - WhatsApp Photo Distribution Bot

<div align="center">

</div>

## Project Overview

Shula is a WhatsApp bot that uses face recognition to intelligently distribute photos within WhatsApp groups. When photos are shared in a group, Shula identifies individuals (typically children) in the photos and forwards only relevant photos to their parents, eliminating the clutter of receiving all group photos.

### Key Features

- **Automated Photo Distribution**: Parents receive only photos containing their children
- **Face Recognition**: Advanced facial recognition for accurate matching
- **Multi-Group Support**: Works simultaneously in hundreds of WhatsApp groups
- **Multi-Child Support**: Parents can register multiple children for recognition
- **High Availability**: Stateless WhatsApp container ensures reliable service

## Architecture

Shula is built as an NX monorepo with two main services:

- **Backend Service (NestJS)**: Core processing engine, API, database operations
- **WhatsApp Container**: Manages WhatsApp connections and messaging

The system is containerized with Docker and deployed using Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service).

## Getting Started

### Quick Start with Docker Compose
1. Ensure Docker is installed.
2. Run `docker compose up --build` to start all services.
3. Scan the QR code from the `whatsapp` container logs to authenticate.
4. Access the admin UI at http://localhost:3200 and the API at http://localhost:3000/api.


### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL
- Redis

### Development Setup

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/shula.git
   cd shula
   ```

2. Run the setup script
   ```
   ./scripts/setup.sh
   ```
   
   This script will:
   - Check prerequisites
   - Install dependencies
   - Start infrastructure (PostgreSQL and Redis)
   - Set up the database
   - Build shared packages

3. Start the application
   ```
   npm run dev:all
   ```

4. Access the services:
   - Backend API: http://localhost:3000/api
   - Swagger API docs: http://localhost:3000/api/docs

## NX Workspace Information

‚ú® Your new, shiny [Nx workspace](https://nx.dev) is almost ready ‚ú®.

[Learn more about this workspace setup and its capabilities](https://nx.dev/nx-api/js?utm_source=nx_project&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=nx_projects) or run `npx nx graph` to visually explore what was created. Now, let's get you up to speed!

## Finish your CI setup

[Click here to finish setting up your workspace!](https://cloud.nx.app/connect/eAt0QU1RTv)


## Generate a library

```sh
npx nx g @nx/js:lib packages/pkg1 --publishable --importPath=@my-org/pkg1
```

## Run tasks

To build the library use:

```sh
npx nx build pkg1
```

To run any task with Nx use:

```sh
npx nx <target> <project-name>
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

[More about running tasks in the docs &raquo;](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Versioning and releasing

To version and release the library use

```
npx nx release
```

Pass `--dry-run` to see what would happen without actually releasing the library.

## Keep TypeScript project references up to date

Nx automatically updates TypeScript [project references](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html) in `tsconfig.json` files to ensure they remain accurate based on your project dependencies (`import` or `require` statements). This sync is automatically done when running tasks such as `build` or `typecheck`, which require updated references to function correctly.

To manually trigger the process to sync the project graph dependencies information to the TypeScript project references, run the following command:

```sh
npx nx sync
```

You can enforce that the TypeScript project references are always in the correct state when running in CI by adding a step to your CI job configuration that runs the following command:

```sh
npx nx sync:check
```
